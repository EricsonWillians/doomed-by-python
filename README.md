## ðŸ”¥ "ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO RUN THIS LAUNCHER" ðŸ”¥

Welcome, mortal.  
You stand at the gateway to **DOOMED BY PYTHON**â€”a launcher so retro, so blue, so absolutely *cursed* that even your config files might burst into flames.

No more batch files. No more hand-editing command lines.  
Just a *searing*, 90s BBS-inspired interface for GZDoom. Complete with a floating lost soul, ANSI colors, and real modder suffering.
