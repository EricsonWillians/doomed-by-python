# Doomed by Python

Doomed by Python is a simple yet useful mod launcher for GZDoom / Zandronum players, especially interesting for linux users.

## Features

- IWAD chooser.
- Multiple PWAD selection.
- Previously selected launch options are saved on a JSON file for fast launching.

## Future features

- Full support for GZDoom command-line parameters.
- Maybe a Deutex wrapper, since I gave up the wad finder idea.
- Windows support.
- Who knows?
